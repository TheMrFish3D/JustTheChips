# JustTheChips

A comprehensive CNC machining calculator that provides accurate spindle speeds, feed rates, power requirements, and tool deflection estimates for various machining operations.

## Features

- **Comprehensive calculations**: RPM, feed rates, chipload, cutting forces, power requirements, and tool deflection
- **Material library**: Extensive database of cutting parameters for different materials
- **Tool database**: Support for various tool types (endmills, drills, face mills, etc.)
- **Machine profiles**: Configurable machine and spindle specifications
- **Real-time warnings**: Intelligent alerts for power limits, deflection, and cutting parameters
- **Modern UI**: Built with React + TypeScript for a responsive, professional interface

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheMrFish3D/JustTheChips.git
   cd JustTheChips
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd web && npm install --ignore-scripts
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:5174

### Building for Production

#### Quick Deployment (Recommended)

Use the provided deployment scripts for your platform:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
deploy.bat
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
```

The deployment scripts will:
- Check Node.js and npm installation
- Install all dependencies
- Run code linting
- Build the application for production
- Provide deployment instructions

#### Manual Build

```bash
cd web
npm run build
npm run preview  # Preview the built application
```

## Deployment

JustTheChips includes cross-platform deployment scripts to simplify building and deploying the application.

### Deployment Scripts

| Platform | Script | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Linux/macOS | `./deploy.sh` | Bash script for Unix-like systems |
| Windows | `deploy.bat` | Batch script for Windows Command Prompt |
| Windows | `.\deploy.ps1` | PowerShell script with enhanced features |

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Deployment Process

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheMrFish3D/JustTheChips.git
   cd JustTheChips
   ```

2. **Run the deployment script for your platform**:
   
   **Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   
   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
   ```cmd
   deploy.bat
   ```
   
   **Windows (PowerShell with optional preview):**
   ```powershell
   # Basic deployment
   .\deploy.ps1
   
   # Skip preview prompt
   .\deploy.ps1 -SkipPreview
   
   # Show help
   .\deploy.ps1 -Help
   ```

3. **Deploy the built files**:
   After successful build, upload the contents of `web/dist/` to your web server.

### What the Scripts Do

- ‚úÖ Verify Node.js 18+ and npm installation
- üì¶ Install root and web dependencies  
- üîç Run ESLint code quality checks
- üî® Build the application for production
- üìä Display build summary and file counts
- üåê Provide preview and deployment instructions

### Manual Preview

After building, you can preview the application locally:

```bash
cd web
npm run preview
```

The preview server will start on `http://localhost:4173`.

## Usage

1. **Select your machine** and spindle configuration
2. **Choose your tool** from the database or add custom specifications  
3. **Select material** and cutting operation type
4. **Adjust cutting parameters** (depth of cut, width of cut, aggressiveness)
5. **Review calculated results** including RPM, feed rate, power requirements, and warnings

The calculator provides intelligent warnings for:
- Power limitations
- Excessive tool deflection  
- Chipload optimization
- Feed rate constraints
