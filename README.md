# JustTheChips

A comprehensive CNC machining calculator that provides accurate spindle speeds, feed rates, power requirements, and tool deflection estimates for various machining operations.

## Features

- **Comprehensive calculations**: RPM, feed rates, chipload, cutting forces, power requirements, and tool deflection
- **Material library**: Extensive database of cutting parameters for different materials
- **Tool database**: Support for various tool types (endmills, drills, face mills, etc.)
- **Machine profiles**: Configurable machine and spindle specifications
- **Real-time warnings**: Intelligent alerts for power limits, deflection, and cutting parameters
- **Modern UI**: Built with React + TypeScript for a responsive, professional interface

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheMrFish3D/JustTheChips.git
   cd JustTheChips
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd web && npm install --ignore-scripts
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:5174

### Building for Production

```bash
cd web
npm run build
npm run preview  # Preview the built application
```

## Usage

1. **Select your machine** and spindle configuration
2. **Choose your tool** from the database or add custom specifications  
3. **Select material** and cutting operation type
4. **Adjust cutting parameters** (depth of cut, width of cut, aggressiveness)
5. **Review calculated results** including RPM, feed rate, power requirements, and warnings

The calculator provides intelligent warnings for:
- Power limitations
- Excessive tool deflection  
- Chipload optimization
- Feed rate constraints

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, data-driven architecture:

- **Data Layer** (`web/src/core/data/`): Material properties, tool specifications, machine configurations, and spindle parameters
- **Calculation Engine** (`web/src/core/calculations/`): Pure functions for speeds, feeds, power, deflection, and validation
- **UI Layer** (`web/src/`): React components for user interaction and results display
- **Utilities** (`web/src/core/utils/`): Mathematical helpers and shared constants
