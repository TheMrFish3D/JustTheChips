# TODO - Just the Chip Development

## Current Status
✅ Basic application structure created
✅ Dark theme implemented
✅ Main UI components created
✅ GitHub Pages deployment setup
✅ Build system working

## Unfinished Work

### High Priority
- [ ] **Real Machining Calculations**: Replace mock data with actual feeds and speeds calculations
  - [ ] Surface speed calculations (SFM/SMM)
  - [ ] Feed per tooth calculations based on material properties
  - [ ] Spindle power requirements
  - [ ] Cutting force calculations
  - [ ] Material removal rate calculations
  - [ ] Motor torque requirements

- [ ] **Material Database**: Create comprehensive material property database
  - [ ] Cutting speeds for different materials
  - [ ] Tool life factors
  - [ ] Surface finish factors
  - [ ] Work hardening properties

- [ ] **Locked Parameters Feature**: Allow users to lock specific parameters
  - [ ] Lock/unlock toggles for each parameter
  - [ ] Validation to prevent impossible parameter combinations
  - [ ] Warning system for conflicting locked parameters

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Detailed Analysis View**: Click on table rows to show detailed analysis
  - [ ] Parameter comparison graphs
  - [ ] Optimal range indicators
  - [ ] Recommendations

- [ ] **Tool Database**: Expand tool configurations
  - [ ] Manufacturer-specific tool data
  - [ ] Tool geometry effects on calculations
  - [ ] Tool wear calculations

- [ ] **Advanced Machine Features**:
  - [ ] Support for different spindle types (not just VFD)
  - [ ] Servo motor configurations
  - [ ] Machine rigidity factors

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Real-time Calculations**: Update calculations as user types
- [ ] **Save/Load Configurations**: Persist user settings
- [ ] **Print/Share Results**: Generate reports
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize for mobile devices
- [ ] **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Help System**: Tooltips and documentation

### Technical Debt
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Testing**: Add unit tests for calculation functions
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize re-renders with React.memo
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Split large components into smaller ones

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization
- [ ] **Advanced Materials**: Composites, ceramics, exotic alloys
- [ ] **Toolpath Integration**: Connect with CAM software
- [ ] **Machine Learning**: Optimize parameters based on user feedback
- [ ] **Cloud Sync**: Save configurations to cloud storage

## Notes
- Current implementation uses mock calculation data for demonstration
- All calculations must be validated against real-world machining practices
- UI design follows minimal dark theme as specified in requirements
- Application is designed for GitHub Pages deployment simplicity
