## Methodology

### Rigidity Factor Calculation
Rigidity factors were calculated based on comparative analysis with established machine types:

**Reference Points:**
- Entry VMC: 0.8 (professional baseline)
- Benchtop Mill: 0.45 (hobby professional baseline)
- Lowrider v3: 0.25 (large hobby CNC baseline)

**Factors Considered:**
1. **Frame Material Impact:**
   - Aluminum 2020: Base factor
   - Aluminum 3030/4040: 1.5-2x improvement
   - Steel construction: 3-4x improvement

2. **Spindle Mount Rigidity:**
   - Plastic mount: -30% penalty
   - Basic aluminum: Baseline
   - Precision aluminum: +20%
   - Steel mount: +50%

3. **Linear Motion Quality:**
   - Basic V-wheels: Baseline
   - Precision V-wheels: +15%
   - Linear bearings: +40%

4. **Overall Mass and Damping:**
   - Weight directly correlates with vibration damping
   - Cross-bracing adds 20-30% improvement

### Validation Against Real-World Performance
The calculated rigidity factors align with community reports and cutting parameter recommendations:
- Basic 3018: Limited to very light cuts in soft materials
- Pro variants: Capable of moderate cuts in aluminum and plastics
- Steel variants: Approaching capabilities of entry-level hobby mills

## Impact on Cutting Parameters

The refined rigidity factors will result in:
- More conservative recommendations for basic 3018 machines
- Improved cutting capabilities for higher-end variants
- Better surface finish predictions through accurate deflection modeling
- Reduced tool breakage through appropriate force limiting

## Recommendations for Users

1. **3018 Basic**: Ideal for PCB milling, engraving, very light cuts
2. **3018 Pro**: Suitable for hobby projects in aluminum, plastic
3. **3018 Pro Max**: Good for small production work in soft materials
4. **3018 Steel**: Approaches benchtop mill capabilities for small parts

This analysis provides the foundation for accurate cutting parameter calculations specific to 3018 CNC machine variants.
