## Aggressiveness Factor Research

### Theoretical Foundation

Aggressiveness factors compensate for machine limitations by reducing cutting parameters from theoretical optimums. These factors address:

1. **Structural Rigidity:** Lower rigidity requires reduced forces to prevent deflection
2. **Dynamic Response:** Poor damping characteristics necessitate conservative parameters
3. **Power Limitations:** Reduced spindle power limits material removal rates
4. **Precision Constraints:** Backlash and compliance affect achievable tolerances

### Empirical Scaling Relationships

Based on analysis of successful hobby machining practices and commercial recommendations:

#### Axial Aggressiveness (Depth of Cut)
- **Ultra-Light:** 0.2-0.3 (80% reduction from industrial)
- **Medium:** 0.3-0.5 (70% reduction)
- **Heavy:** 0.6-0.7 (40% reduction)
- **Entry Commercial:** 0.7-0.8 (25% reduction)

**Rationale:** Axial engagement creates highest bending moments on tools. Hobby machines' reduced rigidity cannot support industrial-level axial loads without excessive deflection.

#### Radial Aggressiveness (Width of Cut)
- **Ultra-Light:** 0.3-0.4 (70% reduction)
- **Medium:** 0.4-0.6 (50% reduction)
- **Heavy:** 0.7-0.8 (25% reduction)
- **Entry Commercial:** 0.8-0.9 (15% reduction)

**Rationale:** Radial forces directly stress machine structure. Conservative radial engagement prevents chatter and maintains dimensional accuracy.

#### Feed Aggressiveness
- **Ultra-Light:** 0.4-0.5 (60% reduction)
- **Medium:** 0.5-0.7 (40% reduction)
- **Heavy:** 0.7-0.8 (25% reduction)
- **Entry Commercial:** 0.8-0.9 (15% reduction)

**Rationale:** Feed rates must account for reduced machine dynamics and servo capabilities while ensuring proper chip formation.

## Material-Specific Considerations for Low-Rigidity Machines

#### Hobby Machine Reality:
Ultra-light machines often cannot achieve tight tolerances due to inherent deflection limitations.

### Tool Selection Guidelines

#### Diameter-to-Length Ratios:
- **Ultra-Light Machines:** L/D ≤ 3 for precision, ≤ 4 for general work
- **Medium Machines:** L/D ≤ 4 for precision, ≤ 6 for general work
- **Heavy Machines:** L/D ≤ 6 for precision, ≤ 8 for general work

#### Material Selection:
- **Carbide Preferred:** 3x stiffness of HSS critical for hobby machines
- **Stub Length Tools:** Use shortest possible tools for maximum rigidity
- **Tapered Tools:** Consider for deep pockets to maintain stiffness

### Force-Based Deflection Limits

#### Maximum Recommended Forces:
- **3mm Tools:** 20N (ultra-light), 40N (medium), 80N (heavy)
- **6mm Tools:** 50N (ultra-light), 100N (medium), 200N (heavy)
- **12mm Tools:** 100N (ultra-light), 200N (medium), 400N (heavy)

These limits ensure deflection remains below 0.02mm for general machining.
